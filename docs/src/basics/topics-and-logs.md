# Topics & Logs

In Zeebe, all data is organied into topics.

> Note: If you have worked with the [Apache Kafka System](https://kafka.apache.org/), the concepts presented on this page will sound very familiar to you.

You can think of a topic as a never ending ordered list of entries.

## Entries and Positions

Initially, the stream is empty. As the first entry gets inserted, it takes the place of the first entry. As the second entry comes in and is inserted, it takes the place as the second entry,and so on and so forth.



The processing of the stream is done by stream processors.
